# EcoDAO 🌱

## Decentralized Community Governance for Environmental Action**

EcoDAO empowers local communities to democratically fund and manage sustainability initiatives through blockchain governance and token-based incentives.

## 🎯 Problem

Communities lack coordinated mechanisms to incentivize individual environmental actions and democratically allocate resources for sustainability projects. Traditional approaches suffer from:

- Lack of transparency in funding decisions
- No rewards for individual eco-actions
- Centralized decision-making
- Limited community engagement

## 💡 Solution

EcoDAO creates a decentralized autonomous organization where:

- **Residents earn governance tokens** for verified environmental actions
- **Community votes** on sustainability project funding using earned tokens
- **Transparent allocation** of resources through smart contracts
- **Gamified engagement** encouraging continued participation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Polygon)

- **GreenToken.sol**: ERC-20 governance token with voting extensions
- **GreenGovernor.sol**: OpenZeppelin Governor for proposal voting
- **ActionRewards.sol**: Token distribution for verified eco-actions
- **CommunityTreasury.sol**: Automated funding of approved projects

### Frontend (React + Next.js)

- **Dashboard**: Token balance, voting power, community stats
- **Actions Hub**: Submit eco-actions with photo verification
- **Governance Portal**: Create proposals, vote on initiatives
- **Community Feed**: Showcase funded projects and impact

### Integration Layer

- **Web3 Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect support
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized storage for photos and proposals
- **Oracle System**: Community-based action verification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MetaMask wallet
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcoDAO.git
cd EcoDAO

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your private keys and RPC URLs

# Deploy smart contracts (testnet)
npm run deploy:testnet

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=80001  # Polygon Mumbai
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=your_polygon_rpc_url
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### For Community Members

1. **Connect wallet** to the EcoDAO platform
2. **Submit eco-actions** with photo proof (composting, energy saving, cycling, etc.)
3. **Earn EcoTokens** after community verification
4. **Vote on proposals** for community sustainability projects
5. **Track impact** through transparent project updates

### For Project Proposers

1. **Submit project proposal** with funding requirements and timeline
2. **Community discussion** period for feedback and refinement
3. **Token holder voting** determines funding approval
4. **Automatic fund release** upon milestone completion
5. **Progress reporting** to maintain transparency
