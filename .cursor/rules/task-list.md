## Notes for Cursor AI

**Development Priorities:**

1. Working smart contracts are critical
2. Basic governance functionality must work
3. Clean, professional UI is important
4. Demo smoothness over feature completeness

**Code Style:**

- Use TypeScript throughout
- Follow Next.js 13+ app router patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Use Tailwind for consistent styling

**Web3 Best Practices:**

- Always validate contract addresses
- Handle transaction failures gracefully
- Implement proper wallet connection states
- Add network switching capabilities
- Use ethers.js for contract interactions

**Testing Strategy:**

- Test each component in isolation
- Verify smart contract interactions
- Test responsive design on mobile
- Validate form submissions and edge cases
