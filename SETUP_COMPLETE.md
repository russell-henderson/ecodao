# 🎉 EcoDAO Setup Complete!

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Network Migration: Mumbai → Amoy
- **Updated all configurations** to use Polygon Amoy testnet (Chain ID: 80002)
- **Replaced deprecated Mumbai references** throughout the codebase
- **Updated package.json scripts** for Amoy deployment
- **Enhanced hardhat.config.ts** with proper network configurations

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment
- **All 5 contracts deploy successfully** on local Hardhat network
- **Contract addresses auto-update** in frontend via deployment script
- **Enhanced governance ABIs** with detailed function signatures for proposal creation
- **Comprehensive test suite** passes (13/13 tests)

### 3. Frontend Configuration
- **Environment updated** to use Amoy testnet (Chain ID: 80002)
- **WalletConnect project ID** properly configured
- **Frontend builds successfully** with Turbopack (0 errors, only unused import warnings)
- **Contract integration** ready for Amoy deployment

### 4. Enhanced Developer Experience
- **Environment check script** (`npm run check`) for quick status verification
- **Streamlined setup commands** (`npm run setup:local`, `npm run setup:amoy`)
- **Comprehensive documentation** in COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- **Auto-generated contract addresses** and TypeScript types

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Deploy to Amoy Testnet
```bash
cd contracts
npm run setup:amoy
```

This requires:
- Private key in `.env` file
- Test MATIC from [Polygon Amoy Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Governance Flow
1. **Connect wallet** to Amoy testnet
2. **Submit environmental actions** with photos
3. **Get community verification** to earn tokens
4. **Delegate tokens** to yourself for voting power
5. **Create proposals** through the governance interface

## 🔧 Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run check` | Check environment status |
| `npm run setup:local` | Deploy locally for testing |
| `npm run setup:amoy` | Deploy to Amoy testnet |
| `npm run test` | Run smart contract tests |
| `npm run compile` | Compile contracts + generate types |

## 📊 Governance Parameters

- **Proposal Threshold**: 100 GREEN tokens
- **Voting Delay**: 1 day (allows snapshot creation)
- **Voting Period**: 7 days (community voting)
- **Quorum**: 10% of total token supply

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot create proposals"
- **Solution**: Earn 100+ tokens through verified actions, delegate to self, wait 1 day

### "Wrong network" errors
- **Solution**: Add Amoy network to MetaMask (Chain ID: 80002, RPC: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology)

### "Insufficient funds"
- **Solution**: Get test MATIC from the Polygon Amoy faucet
