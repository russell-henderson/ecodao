## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**

### 1. **Contract Interaction Issues**
- ❌ `ActionRewards.setGovernor()` call failing with execution revert
- ❌ `ActionRewards.submitAction()` calls also reverting
- ❌ Root cause: Unknown (access controls pass, state checks pass)
- 🔧 **Impact**: Live blockchain testing blocked, demo mode functional

### 2. **Contract Verification**
- ❌ Polygonscan verification failing due to deprecated API
- 🔧 **Workaround**: Manual verification or flattening required
- 📝 **Status**: Not blocking functionality, only explorer visibility

### 3. **Governor Integration**
- ❌ Governor not properly connected to ActionRewards
- 🔧 **Impact**: Proposals not auto-generated from actions
- 📝 **Status**: Demo data shows intended functionality
