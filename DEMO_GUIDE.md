# EcoDAO Demo Guide

## üåü Project Overview

**EcoDAO: The First Neighborhood Climate Democracy**

EcoDAO is a blockchain-based environmental governance platform that empowers communities to create local environmental impact through democratic decision-making and tokenized incentives.

### Core Innovation
- **Action ‚Üí Governance Pipeline**: Environmental actions automatically become community governance proposals
- **Tokenized Incentives**: EcoTokens earned through verified actions provide voting power
- **Democratic Climate Action**: Community verifies actions and votes on environmental initiatives

## üéØ Demo Flow

### **Step 1: Action Submission**
1. Navigate to `/actions`
2. Connect wallet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
3. Select action type (e.g., "Tree Planting")
4. Upload proof photo
5. Submit action ‚Üí Transaction creates governance proposal

### **Step 2: Community Verification**
1. View pending actions in governance dashboard
2. Community members review submitted proof
3. Vote to verify or reject actions
4. Approved actions mint EcoTokens to submitter

### **Step 3: Governance Participation**
1. Navigate to `/governance`
2. Browse active proposals (generated from actions)
3. Use EcoTokens to vote on community decisions
4. See real-time results and voting progress

### **Step 4: Project Funding**
1. Token holders propose new environmental initiatives
2. Community votes on funding allocation
3. Approved projects receive automated token distribution
4. Track project milestones and impact
